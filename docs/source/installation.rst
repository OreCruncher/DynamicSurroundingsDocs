Installation
============
Dynamic Surroundings can be downloaded from two different locations:

* `Dynamic Surroundings on CurseForge <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-surroundings/files>`_
* `Dynamic Surroundings on Modrinth <https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamicsurroundingsfabric/versions>`_

Both Fabric and NeoForge versions have a dependency on the Architectury mod. That mod can be found:

* `Architectury on CurseForge <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architectury-api>`_
* `Architectury on Modrinth <https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api>`_

To access in game menus for configuration, Cloth-Config should be installed. There is no hard requirement, however.
