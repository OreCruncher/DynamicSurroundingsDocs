"Sound reverb in caves" demonstrates the enhanced sound processing system. Sounds in large enclosed areas with reflective surfaces will produce a reverb effect.
The amount of reverb produced is dependent on the volume of the enclosed space. Please note that reverb and echo are two entirely different things.

"Steam, flame jets, and waterfalls" demonstrates:

* Steam: Produced when hot blocks, such as lava, comes in contact with water.
* Flame Jets: Lava blocks can produce flame jets. The height of the jet is based on how deep the lava is beneath the block in question. The higher the jet, the deeper the lava pool.
* Waterfalls: Water falling from a height will produce splash particles as well as sound. The height of the water column determines how many particles are produced as well as the intensity of the sound.
