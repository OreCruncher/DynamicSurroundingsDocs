The dimensions configuration allows for overriding a dimensions proeprties as defined within the registries. Sometimes the registered information is incorrect, or the dimension is unqiue in some way that causes effects generated by
Dynamic Surroundings to not make sense. Such dimensions could include mining dimensions with higher sealevels or those that are entirely enclosed.

    *   - Property
        - Value Type
        - Comment
    *   - dimId
        - ResourceLocation
        - The resource location ID of the dimension. It is a required property.
    *   - seaLevel
        - Integer
        - The block Y level that is considered sea level. It is used when calculating whether the player is under ground. Default is not specified, meaning Dynamic Surroundings will rely on the dimension information defined in the registries.
    *   - skyHeight
        - Integer
        - The block Y level that is considered sky. It is used when calculating the threshold of the virtual sky biome. Default is the world height of the dimension as defined in the registries.
    *   - cloudHeight
        - Integer
        - The block Y level that is considered clouds. It is used when calculating the threshold of the virtual cloud biome. Default is the world height of the dimension as defined in the registries.
    *   - alwaysOutside
        - Boolean
        - Indicates if sound effects processing should consider this dimension as always being outside. Helps with defining biome sounds for dimensions that are enclosed. Default is ``false``.
    *   - playBiomeSounds
        - Boolean
        - Indicates if any biome sounds should be generated in the dimension. Default is ``true``.
